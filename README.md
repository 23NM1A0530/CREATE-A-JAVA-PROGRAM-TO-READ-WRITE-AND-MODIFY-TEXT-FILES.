CREATEING A JAVA PROGRAM TO READ, WRITE, AND MODIFY TEXT FILES. WE USE FILE AND FILEWRITER CLASSES FROM (JAVA.IO) PACKAGE AND SCANNER CLASS FROM (JAVA.UTIL)Â PACKAGE

This Java project demonstrates basic file operations such as reading, writing, and modifying text files. 
Creating a File: It attempts to create a file named "myfile.txt". If the file already exists, it notifies the user.
Writing to the File: It writes the text "program to show file handling in java" to the file.
Reading from the File: It reads the contents of the file and prints them to the console.
Exception Handling: It handles potential IOException errors, such as issues in file creation, writing, or reading.
